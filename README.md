# Optimized-Search
A software that given a query search for the result as fast as possible in a big data, with a binary tree combined with a list. This was developed with C.

It was asked to do a search for a course and the students that had grades equal, higher or lower than a certain grade. For that, the user will have to introduce queries like:

C5+15, where C5 is the course number 5 and +15 requires the students that had grades in that course higher than 15;

C3+10C18-16, and returned the students that had grades higher than 10 in the course number 3 and lower than 16 in the course 18.
